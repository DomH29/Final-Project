Description of Targets
TODO: Answer the questions below.
The target of this attack was: Target 1 (192.168.1.110).
Target 1 is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports of entry for attackers. As such, the following alerts have been implemented:
Monitoring the Targets
Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the alerts below:
Excessive HTTP Errors
Metric: WHEN count() GROUPED OVER top 5 â€˜http.response.status_code
Threshold: 400
Vulnerability Mitigated: Brute Force
Reliability: High


HTTP Request Size Monitor
Metric: WHEN sum() of http.request.bytes OVER all documents
Threshold: IS ABOVE 3500
Vulnerability Mitigated: Code Injection 
Reliability: Medium

CPU Usage Monitor
Metric: WHEN max() OF system.process.cpu.total.pct OVER all documents
Threshold: IS ABOVE 0.5
Vulnerability Mitigated: Malware/Viruses
Reliability: High
